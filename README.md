# Task Manager

This program assists in managing the tasks assigned to each member in team. This program consists of two text files, tasks.txt
and user.txt. The tasks.txt file consists of all the tasks the team is working on. The program opens these files and 
runs by using the information from these text files.

The tasks.txt file includes:
* The username of the person to whom the task is assigned.
* The username of the person to whom the task is assigned.
* The title of the task.
* A description of the task.
* The date that the task was assigned to the user.
*  The due date for the task.
* Either a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ value that specifies if the task has been completed yet.

The user.txt file includes:
* Username for each user.
* Password for each user.

Users are able to add a task, view all their tasks and exit. The admin is able to do the same but is the only user 
allowed to register users and display statistics. This program was created using python.
